C for Metal Tutorial
====================

Primary Author(s): Gang Chen and Guei-Yuan Lueh (with sources from current and past C for Metal members)

Special thanks to our previous teammates in UK, David Stuttard, Tim Renouf, Tim Corringham, and Stephen Thomas.

Intro: Comparing C for Metal with CUDA/OpenCL
=============================================

Similarities
------------

* Program for GPU acceleration: host program on CPU; kernel program on GPU.

* Host API provided in C++.  GPU kernel programming in a subset of C++.

Differences
-----------

* Explicit SIMD-programming model. Allow varying SIMD width.

* One C for Metal thread is equivalent to one CUDA warp or one OCL subgroup, operates on a block of pixels instead of one pixel.

  * access the entire vector register file instead of one-lane of the register file. Enable developers to achieve the most efficient register usage.

* Predefined vector and matrix type.

  * Natural representation of media data

  * Parallelism expressed through vector and matrix operations

* Expose GEN hardware media-acceleration functions

* Cm is good for applications that

  * Need cross SIMD-lane operations

  * Need mixed SIMD width

  * Need to change data layout (e.g., transpose)
